                    This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
                    However, the app may use third party code and libraries that
                    use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
                    services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
                    these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your

                    I may employ third-party companies
                    and individuals due to the following reasons:
                  </p> <ul><li><p>To facilitate our Service</p></li> <li><p>To provide the Service on our behalf;</p></li> <li><p>To perform Service-related services; or</p></li> <li><p>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p></li></ul> <p>
                    I want to inform users of this
                    Service that these third parties have access to your
                    Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
                    assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                    not to disclose or use the information for any other
                    purpose.

				  <div class="m-t-15 m-b-15"><strong>Security</strong></div> 
				  <p>
                    I value your trust in providing us
                    your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
                    that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                    of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                    I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
